# :fontawesome-solid-comments: Threads

##Overview
Threads are a powerful feature in Codiumate designed to enrich your interaction with the AI, allowing for deeper exploration, refinement, and expansion of responses to your commands. By engaging in a thread, you can fine-tune results, request additional information, or direct the conversation to more specific outcomes. This feature supports an iterative dialogue with Codiumate, making it possible to evolve initial responses into comprehensive solutions.

##Supported Commands
Threads enhance the functionality of several Codiumate commands by allowing users to delve deeper into their initial inquiries. Below is a list of commands that support the threading option, each linked to its respective documentation page for detailed information:

- [free chat](./modes/free-chat.md) : In free chat mode, each message can start a new thread.
- [`/ask`](./commands/ask.md): Pose coding-related queries and receive detailed explanations.
- [`/explain`](./commands/explain.md): Get a thorough explanation of specific code segments or concepts.
- [`/docstring`](./commands/docstring.md): Generate or improve docstrings for better code documentation.
- [`/quick-test`](./commands/quick-test.md): Create initial test suites with the option to refine and expand them.
- [`/commit`](./commands/commit.md): Generate commit messages based on changes, with the ability to fine-tune the message.
- [`/describe`](./commands/describe.md): Obtain structured descriptions of changesets, ideal for pull requests.
- [`/recap`](./commands/recap.md): Summarize code changes in detail, allowing for further clarification and expansion.
- [`/issues`](./commands/issues.md): Identify and explore potential issues within your codebase.
- [`/improve`](./commands/improve.md) (Workspace mode only): Suggest improvements for identified issues, enhancing code quality.
- [`/update-changelog`](./commands/update-changelog.md): Automatically update the changelog, with options for customization and additional context.

After receiving an initial response to these commands, you'll see a "continue this chat" button. Clicking this button will lead you into a thread where you can request more detailed follow-ups, refine the outcome, or explore related topics further.


##How to Use Threads

1. **Initiate a Command**: Start by executing a command as you normally would in the appropriate mode (Free Chat, File, or Workspace Mode).
2. **Extend the Conversation**: At the end of the response, click the "continue this chat" button to open a thread. This action shifts the dialogue into a focused conversation window where you can build upon the initial response.
3. **Refine and Expand**: Within the thread, you can ask for more details, request modifications, or explore additional scenarios related to your initial query. Codiumate will maintain the context of the ongoing conversation, providing tailored follow-up responses.

##Examples

!!! example "Workspace Mode Issue Resolution"
    - **Initial Command**: Call the `/issues` command to identify potential issues in your codebase.
    - **In a Thread**: Dive into a specific issue listed in the initial response, asking Codiumate for potential solutions or workaround strategies.

!!! example "File Mode Test Suite Refinement"
    - **Initial Command**: Use `/quick-test` to generate an initial test suite for a piece of code.
    - **In a Thread**: Request refinements to the test suite, such as adding more tests, changing the testing framework, incorporating mocks, or adjusting to different testing scenarios.

!!! example "Free Chat Mode Code Evolution"
    - **Initial Request**: Ask Codiumate to generate a class based on your specifications.
    - **In a Thread**: Further develop the class by requesting additional functions, changing coding styles, or integrating design patterns.

##Benefits of Using Threads

- **Detailed Exploration**: Threads allow for a granular examination of Codiumate's responses, enabling you to get precisely what you need.
- **Iterative Improvement**: You can iteratively refine Codiumate's output, ensuring the final result closely matches your requirements.
- **Contextual Continuity**: Threads maintain the context of your conversation, allowing Codiumate to provide more accurate and relevant responses with each interaction.

Threads are an essential tool in Codiumate, bridging the gap between initial automated responses and the nuanced, detailed solutions developers need. By leveraging threads, you ensure that your interactions with Codiumate are as productive and informative as possible.
