## Overview 

Welcome to Codiumate Chat, the integrated chat-based assistant designed to elevate your coding experience. Leveraging the power of advanced language models, Codiumate offers real-time coding assistance, documentation generation, code review, and more, all within your development environment. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, Codiumate streamlines your workflow, enhances code quality, and accelerates your project development.

## Key Features

### Modes
To suit the context of your work, Codiumate offers three distinct modes:

- **Free Chat Mode**: Ideal for general coding questions and discussions, without the need for specific code context.
- **File Mode**: Focuses on the current file, offering detailed assistance and command functionality for selected lines, components, or file changes.
- **Workspace Mode**: Expands Codiumate's scope to your entire project workspace, allowing for comprehensive analysis and actions on changesets. Available for Teams and Enterprise users. 

Each mode is designed to optimize Codiumate's assistance based on the scope of your coding tasks. [Discover more about modes](./modes/index.md).

### Commands
Codiumate provides a suite of commands tailored to various coding needs, from generating docstrings and reviewing code to identifying issues and updating changelogs. Commands like [`/ask`](./commands/ask.md), [`/explain`](./commands/explain.md), [`/commit`](./commands/commit.md), and [`/improve`](./commands/improve.md) are just the beginning of what Codiumate can do to support your coding journey. [Learn more about commands](./commands/index.md).

### Threads
Threads in Codiumate enable you to dive deeper into specific inquiries or commands. After an initial command execution, the "continue this chat" button allows for a threaded conversation, providing space for refinement, additional queries, and expanded discussions. This feature is invaluable for iterating on solutions, clarifying complex topics, and ensuring you get the most out of Codiumate's capabilities. [Explore threading](./threads.md).
